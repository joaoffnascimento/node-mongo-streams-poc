# ProcessDocumentsWithStream.js - Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. **Scope Issues**

- **Problem**: `processedCount` variable and `this.heavyProcessing` method were not accessible within the Transform stream's `transform` function
- **Fix**: Used `const self = this` to capture the correct context and access methods properly

### 2. **Pipeline Flow Issues**

- **Problem**: `collectStream` was not properly passing data through the pipeline with `callback()`
- **Fix**: Changed to `callback(null, chunk)` to pass data through the stream properly

### 3. **Error Handling**

- **Problem**: Missing error handling in pipeline execution and collectStream
- **Fix**: Added try-catch blocks around pipeline execution and proper error handling in collectStream

### 4. **Options Handling**

- **Problem**: No support for limiting the number of documents processed or configuring batch sizes
- **Fix**: Added support for `options.limit`, `options.batchSize`, and `options.highWaterMark`

### 5. **Progress Reporting**

- **Problem**: Fixed progress reporting frequency and added percentage progress for limited datasets
- **Fix**: Dynamic progress interval based on total documents and better progress indicators

### 6. **Repository Integration**

- **Problem**: Repository's `findAllStream` method didn't support limit option properly
- **Fix**: Updated repository to handle limit option in MongoDB query

## Key Improvements:

1. **Better Memory Management**: Configurable highWaterMark for backpressure control
2. **Flexible Processing**: Support for limiting documents and configurable batch sizes
3. **Enhanced Progress Tracking**: Dynamic progress intervals with percentage completion
4. **Robust Error Handling**: Proper error propagation through the pipeline
5. **Production Ready**: More reliable stream handling and resource cleanup

## Usage Example:

```javascript
const useCase = new ProcessDocumentsWithStream(repository, monitor);

// Process with custom options
const result = await useCase.execute({
  limit: 50000, // Process only 50k documents
  batchSize: 2000, // MongoDB cursor batch size
  highWaterMark: 200, // Stream buffer size
});
```

The fixes ensure the stream processing is now production-ready with proper error handling, configurable options, and reliable memory management.
